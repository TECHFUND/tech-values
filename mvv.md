### 5 Core Values

1) Team > Everything else
    - We are one single unit "TECHFUND" not a frontend/backend/ops team. Each member represents "TECHFUND" all the time by their conduct.
    - Once someone has become a member: We trust, help & guide each other, no matter the situation.
    - The aim of the team is one: "Growth"

### 5 Core Values

2) Numbers don't lie, numbers don't have an opinion.
    - Data will be valued over personal assumptions. We can have a bias because of basic human tendencies. They lead to incorrect decisions, which can harm in long term. Hence as a team, we should always put measurements in place and discuss based on facts & data.

### 5 Core Values

3) 10 Perfect features > 100 imperfect ones
    - If TECHFUND has released one product feature, it should mean it will work in all the conditions. TECHFUND name must become synonynmous with quality.

### 5 Core Values

4) Continuous learning
    - ALWAYS be learning. If we have to become "creators" and not only "users" of technology, we must keep up with upcoming technologies.
    - Have you read about something nice recently? Or tried to play with some new technology? Share the article or your GitHub link!

### 5 Core Values

5) Focus on client
    - Focus on what the client "actually" want to achieve, everything else will follow automatically.
